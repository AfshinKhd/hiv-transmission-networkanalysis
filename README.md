# HIV Transmission Analysis Project

This project focuses on the analysis of HIV transmission using the dataset from the Colorado Index of Complex Networks. Leveraging the NetworkX library and other network analysis tools, we aim to investigate various features related to this critical topic. Our exploration spans the structural and dynamic aspects of HIV transmission networks.

The ultimate goal is to derive insights that can inform and guide the development of effective Prevention Policies. Through rigorous examination and interpretation of the network data, we strive to contribute valuable information to the field and enhance our understanding of HIV transmission dynamics.
